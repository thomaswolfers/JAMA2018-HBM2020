1) gpr - https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit/blob/master/pcntoolkit/normative.py 
    * the results have been reproduced using other algorithms such as BLR etc.
2) normative_parallel - https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit/blob/master/pcntoolkit/normative_parallel.py
    * here you find the parallelization routines for normative modelling
3) we used FSL's PALM for the mean effects
